Changes in Version 0.9-0

  o First CRAN release of the package accompanying the forthcoming
    paper "Accounting for Individual Differences in Bradley-Terry
    Models by Means of Recursive Partitioning" by Strobl, Wickelmaier,
    and Zeileis, accepted for publication in Journal of Educational
    and Behavioral Statistics.
    
  o Compared to earlier package versions available from R-Forge,
    this package does not depend on data/code from the "prefmod2"
    package. All required functionality (basic Bradley-Terry
    regression, paircomp class, data sets) are now contained in the
    "psychotree" package.
